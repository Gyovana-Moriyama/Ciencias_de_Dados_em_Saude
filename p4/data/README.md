## data

As the data is too large to upload on GitHub, we decided to only include the needed auxiliary files. This files are divided into its respective folders.

Also, we are uploading the csv generated from the images that is being used as the classifier input.

In addition, the file 'test_preds.txt' is the classifier predicitons of the SLE images.
