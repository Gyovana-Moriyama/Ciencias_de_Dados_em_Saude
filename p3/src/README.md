To reproduce the article experiments we used Cytoscape 3.9.1 for Windows 64bit (https://cytoscape.org/) with the plug-in proposed in the paper, CentiScaPe 2.2 (https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/centiscape). And to learn how to use Cytoscape and CentiScaPe, we used the following links:

- [Cytoscape: Working with attributes](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w19/tutorials-guides/network-analysis/cytoscape-working-with-attributes/).
- [CentiScape User Guide](http://www.cbmc.it/~scardonig/centiscape/CentiScaPefiles/CentiScaPeUserGuide.pdf)

CentiScaPe can be download on Cytoscape through App Manager.
